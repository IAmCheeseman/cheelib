# CheeLib
A more update friendly version of my previous love2dlib

## Installing

- `cd` into your new project.
- run `git clone https://github.com/IAmCheeseman/cheelib.git cheelib`
- in your main lua file, add `chee = require("cheelib")`

And you're done!

Check out [example_main.lua](https://github.com/IAmCheeseman/cheelib/blob/main/example_main.lua) to see how it's used. :)
